# InfoTrack Development Test

To complete this test I have created a .Net Core Web API along with a Vue.js SPA application.

## Front End Setup

Navigate to the root of the 'front end' folder and run:

```
npm install
```

After the packages have been downloaded run:

```
npm run serve
```

All the code should compile and the App should be running on http://localhost:8080/

## Back End Setup

Double click on backend.sln, this should open up the solution in Visual Studio. Then click F5 to run the solution.

#### Once both the front and back end are running, fill in the form and see the Google rank of your search terms!
